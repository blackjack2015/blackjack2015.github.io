I forked a Jekyll template from [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou), which is Â© 2016 Michael Rose and released under the MIT License. See LICENSE.md. You may visit the original repository for more information. 

I just revised it to be [my own public website](https://blackjack2015.github.io). Welcome to visit it.
